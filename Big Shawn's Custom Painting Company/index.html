                <h2>LEARN ABOUT OUR BUSINESS</h2>
                <p>After completing a seemingly infinite number of residential, commercial, interior, and exterior
                    painting
                    jobs, what we've learned is that what matters most is value and doing a quality job at an affordable
                    and
                    fair price. Approaching every project with the same uncompromising level of care, attention, and
                    professionalism.</p>
                <p>My father and I opened the company back in 2007. In 2014 unfortunately my father passed away. So, I
                    decided to name the company after my father Shawn McCluskey. Hence the name Big Shawn's Painting.
                    Great
                    guy, people loved him, he loved people. A great painter, he taught me everything I know. Since I was
                    16,
                    I have been in the painting field. I'm going on over 25 years' experience and 14 years of running a
                    company. We know how to overcome obstacles and get the job done right. We take great pride in what

                        <p>The exterior of this house was in need of a fresh coat of paint. The old paint was peeling
                            and
                            chipping,
                            making the house look tired and unkempt. After painting, the house now has a fresh and
                            modern
                            look.</p>
